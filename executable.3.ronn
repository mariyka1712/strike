executable(3) -- executable module
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

Module methods for system executables.

## DESCRIPTION

Enables validation and referencing of executables in `$PATH`.

## REQUIRE

In your tasks(7) file `require` the `executable` module using:

	require 'executable';

## USAGE

Once the module is available you can then validate a list of executables:

	executable validate ronn git;
	
If any of the listed executables are not available on the system the program will exit with a non-zero exit code. If executable validation succeeds the executable paths are available in the global `executables` associative array and can be accessed anywhere in the program, for example:

	local git="${executables[git]}";
