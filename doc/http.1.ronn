http(1) -- strike http module using curl(1) 
=============================================

## DESCRIPTION

The http(1) module wraps curl(1) to provide easy access to HTTP(S) functionality from `bash` programs. Note that the http(1) module is configured to follow redirects in the 3xx status code range and therefore multiple response headers may be available.

## FILES

The http(1) module generates some temporary files and some files used for logging purposes stored in `$HOME/.http`.

## Temporary Files

These are files that correspond to the last request made by the http(1) module.

* `http.out`:
	Raw output from executing curl(1).
* `http.head.dump`:
	Raw response headers.
* `http.head`:
	Response headers (without the HTTP status line).
* `http.body`:
	Body of the response.
* `http.trace`:
	Trace output generated by curl(1).
* `http.trace.ascii`:
	ASCII trace output generated by curl(1).
* `http.exit`:
	Contains a non-zero exit code for curl(1).
